// Write a function which takes two numbers and returnst their sum.

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own world?
// implement addition

// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// It depends.
// integer numbers? or floating points?
// How large this number going to be?
// What happens if someone leaves and then put off?

// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// should it be a integer? or float?
// If you pass into floats, do we want to float back?

// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to slove the problem?
// What happens if someone only passes one number?
// Do we add zero? or Do we return like undefined or null or something? => You ask your interviewer that

// 5. How should I lable the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
